![Jeremy and the Vizslador](/assets/img/jwio_splash.jpg){:class="artie"}


I am a second-career software engineer working in the public sector. 
This current life follows many years and many mini-careers and adventures around the world. 
I live in Nashville, Tennessee with several wonderful humans and 
little brown "Vizslador" named Artie. 

By day, I'm writing code in .Net and Angular projects and any other time I'm trying 
to steal an hour or two to tinker with something else. I'm a teacher at heart, and I weirdly enjoy writing documentation, 
so I thought I'd take it a few steps further. Here you'll find my recipes, problems solved, and anything else 
I've considered worth sharing.
