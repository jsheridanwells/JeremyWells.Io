I've always enjoyed software development presentations where the speaker happens to be a nimble Vim user jumping around projects with just a terminal window. However, as I do the majority of my work with .NET, I haven't really been able to separate myself from the massive IDE Visual Studio at work, or JetBrains Rider that provides a similarly pleasant and feature-rich experience working on Mac. Likewise, WebStorm, also from JetBrains, is a tremendously useful IDE for javascript and Node.js development, with Visual Studio Code for anything else. While I've seen some people demonstrate that effective .NET work with just a terminal is indeed possible - [someday, I'd like to spend an afternoon getting this setup to work](https://medium.com/@kpereksta/setting-up-a-c-development-environment-with-vim-on-debian-ea42d5b810) - for now, it's hard to break away from all of the myriad building, debugging, testing, and server tools bundled into Visual Studio.

That said, in my time as a software developer, I would have to say when of the best productivity changes I've made is building up a repertoire of Vim motions to use with Vim plugins for the various tools I use daily. In this article, I'll go over a few ways that incorporating Vim has made tedious file-editing tasks much more fluid for me, ways to get started learning Vim concepts, and some plugins I use in my development tools for adding some Vim usefullness to my setup.
