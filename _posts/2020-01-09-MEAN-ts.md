## Prerequisites

 - Node.js (I'm using version 14.15.1 at the moment).
 - The Angular CLI (I'm using version 11).
 - Typescript (I'm at 4.1.2)

## Set up an empty Angular project

`ng new MEANurls --create-application=false --skip-install=true --new-project-root=.`


CD into the new project directory.

`ng generate application client --skip-install=true`

`ng serve --open` to test.

## Install some packages to support Express.js

- Install in main dependencies:
- `npm install express dotenv body-parser`
- `npm install --save-dev @types/express @types/mongoose livereload connect-livereload`

For now this is what your `package.json` should look like:

 - In `./server`, make these directories: `mkdir bin services routes`
 - Make these files `touch app.ts bin/www`
