            I am a second-career software engineer currently working in the health care sector.
            This follows many years and mini-careers and adventures around the world.
            I live in Nashville, Tennessee with several wonderful humans and
            little brown "Vizslador" named Artie.

            I live in .NET, SQL, Typescript and Angular, while tinkering with various other tools when I can steal an hour or two.
            I'm a teacher at heart, and I weirdly enjoy writing documentation,
            so I thought I'd take it a few steps further. Here you'll find my recipes, lessons, problems solved, and anything else
            I've considered worth sharing.
