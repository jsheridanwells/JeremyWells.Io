            I am a second-career software engineer currently working in the public sector.
            This follows many years and mini-careers and adventures around the world.
            I live in Nashville, Tennessee with several wonderful humans and
            little brown "Vizslador" named Artie.

            By day, I'm writing code in .Net and Angular projects and any other time I'm trying
            to steal an hour or two to tinker with something else. I'm a teacher at heart, and I weirdly enjoy writing documentation,
            so I thought I'd take it a few steps further. Here you'll find my recipes, problems solved, and anything else
            I've considered worth sharing.
